            conversion to kcals/person/day:
            million dry caloric tons monthly * 12 = millon dry caloric tons annually
            million dry caloric tons annually * 1e6 = dry caloric tons annually
            dry caloric tons annually * 1e3 = dry caloric kg annually
            dry caloric kg annually * 4e3 = calories annually (1 kg dry caloric just means the equivalent of 1 kg of sugar)
            calories annually  / 365 = calories per day
            calories per day / 7.8e9 = calories per person per day globally
            therefore:
            calories per person per day globally = million tons dry caloric monthly * 12 * 1e6 * 4e6 / 365 / 7.8e9
            
            conversion to months worth of food:
            million tons dry caloric * 1e6 = tons dry caloric
            tons dry caloric * 1e3 = kg dry caloric
            kg dry caloric * 4e3 = calories
            calories / 2100 = people fed per day
            people fed per day / 30 = people fed per month
            people fed per month / 7.8e9 = fraction of global population fed for a month 
            fraction of global population fed for a month = months global population is fed from this food source
            therefore:
            months global population fed = million tons dry caloric *1e6*4e6 /2100/30/7.8e9
